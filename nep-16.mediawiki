==Abstract==

A <code>NefFile</code> is a file meeting the standard format for a valid NEO executable file. It provides the basic information about the script, including the compiler and version.

This NEP describes the NEF standard for NEO smart contracts.

==Motivation==

Although we use neo-vm as the virtual machine currently, we should have other scripts in the future. A standard definition for the executable file format can guarantee both the feasibility of other vm code and the validity of the script file.

==Specification==

In the field definitions below, we provide both the definitions of the fields as well as the corresponding functions.

==NefFile Structure==

A <code>nef</code> file consists of a stream of 8-bit bytes. Multibyte data items are always stored in little-endian order, where the low bytes come first. Its structure is described further below.

===magic===

The <code>magic</code> item supplies the magic number identifying the <code>NEF3</code> file format; it has the value <code>0x3346454E</code>.

===compiler===

The <code>compiler</code> is a UTF-8 encoded <code>string</code> representing the compiler used to create the data in the <code>script</code> item. It is a fixed-length item, which is padded to force alignment on 32-byte boundary.

===version===

The compiler <code>version</code> is represented using a 32-byte string encoded in UTF-8. It must be padded with padding bytes to make it up to the required length if shorter than 32 bytes.

===reserve===

All bits of the <code>reserve</code> item are reserved for future use. They should be set to zero in generated nef files and should be ignored by Neo Virtual Machine implementations.

===script===

The value of <code>script</code> stores the raw VM opcodes. The data should be serialised using the variable length format as described in the [https://docs.neo.org/developerguide/en/articles/conventions.html#variable-length-types documentation].

===checksum===

The <code>checksum</code> item is used not only to ensure a corrupt-free transmission, but also to ensure that the file has not been tampered with. It is computed by using the SHA256 algorithm to hash the serialised `NefFile` excluding `checksum` twice, and converting the result into a 32-bit unsigned integer.
